HISTORY:
   0.0.0  12/29/94  ACA  Created NTCSSII directory containing programs such as
                    EJT  the user administration utility (users_conf) and the
                         RPC servers (ntcssdsksrv and ntcssServer); established

                         by allowing prime_db program to be rerun until it logs
                         no errors; minor changes to the user administration
