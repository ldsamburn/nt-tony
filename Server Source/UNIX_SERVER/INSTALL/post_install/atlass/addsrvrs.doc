UPDATING THE MASTER SERVER for ATLASS

1. telnet to msysco
2. Login as root
3. cd /usr/local/bin
4. ./ypupdate  (THIS FILE UPDATES THE YPSERVERS FILE)


ADDING UNIX SERVERS TO ATLASS

---Do this after running ypupdate and bringing NTCSSII (ntcss_halt) 
   down on all machines.

****NOTE**** BRING DOWN PAXFERD (THROUGH IF_SERVERNAME - SOFTKILL THE PROCESS)
             AND INTERFACES (through the application) ON ALL SERVERS..MAKE
             SURE AFTER YOU BRING DOWN THE GENS THAT THESE PROCESSES ARE
             DOWN ALONG WITH THE HARDCOPY NOTICE.

RUN ./status_chk


1. Log in as root on the NTCSSII master (msysco).

2. cd /h/NTCSSS/applications/data/install/post_install

3. ./AddNewAtlassSrvr.sh

       and answer the questions asked about the new server(s)


4. When the above shell completes, there will be an updated
   progrps.ini file in the /h/NTCSSS/init_data directory
   containing the new server(s). There will be a backup of
   the original progrps.ini file named progrps.bak in the
   same directory should you have to recover.

5. NTCSSII must be started on each machine (ntcss_init). Start with
   the master server and then progress to the other machines. When
   ntcss_init is run on each slave machine, it will fetch a copy of
   the progrps.ini file from the master server, compare it to the
   progrps.ini file on its own machine, and if the file is newer on
   the master server, it will be copied to the slave server, and 
   initialization will continue.

6. At this time the systems should be up..MAKE SURE PAXFERD, INTERFACES
   AND HARDCOPY NOTICE IS STARTED ON EACH SERVER.

RUN ./status_chk

DO BELOW PROCESS ON msysco ONLY:
cd /h/NTCSSS/bin
./ntcss_make_and_push_nis_maps PUSH
