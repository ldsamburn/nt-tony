The (Master) Server part of the process is complete...

You must now go the NT system and 'FTP' to the Unix server
and retrieve the following file to the c:\ntcss2 directory:

    /nt_import.ini

NOTE: Use the FTP "ASCII" transfer mode..

Then login to NTCSSII as 'ntcssii', execute 'User Administration
and 'import' the 'c:\ntcss2\nt_import.ini' file..
