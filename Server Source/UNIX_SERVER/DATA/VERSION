06-27-2000	Released 806-01.01.11 to CM for TCT and concurrent release
		to Camp Lejeune. This release of NTCSS is intended to enhance
		the user account configuration in a variety of ways.  Other
		improvements and corrections are included and are listed below.

			 Faster user list loading.  Spec'd at 4000 users in
			  less than 5 seconds on a PII-90 with 20MB RAM.
                         Specifying users home and profile directory by
			  BDC/PDC through the UserConfig utility.
			 GUI updated to be more accurate information on
			  login status.
			 Importing users will now either place all home
			  directories on a specified BDC/PDC or prompt the
			  users for each account entry.
			 NIS pull on HP was cached and not retrievable. 
			  This has been corrected by overriding the native
			  NIS pull with a custom pull.
			 Users will no longer be removed from the NTCSS Master
			  if the user is not in a group on the Master host.
			 A conflict in using a temporary DB file was found. 
			  This could have possibly led to database corruption.
			 Adapters may no longer be deleted that have a
			  hostname of an NTCSS host.
			 NTCSS_INIT/HALT have been changed to START/STOP
			  respectively.
			 Ntcss_start now adds lines in the database/progrps.ini
			  file that specify the master NTCSS server name
			  (section MASTER, tag MASTER).
			 Ntcss_make_and_push_nis_maps now use the MASTER tag
			  in the database/progrps.ini file to speed up the NIS
			  push process.
			 Trailing spaces in user names are no longer a problem.
			 Increased number of program groups per user from 64
			  to 400.
			 User import process updated to include DC
			  specification for users (global or individual).
			 User's Unix home directories group ownership is now
			  set to ntcss.


 
06-27-2000	Report from TCT (Jim North) that the install script reports back
		that install.hp1020 "command not found". Modified install
		script to put "./" preceeding install command.
